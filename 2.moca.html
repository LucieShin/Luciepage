<h2> Moca </h2>

<img src="moca" width="50%">
<p><strong> Moca, is the <u>second</u> cat</strong> that Lucie had adopted after Latte as she thought Latte might felt lonely being alone, which was the wrong thought she had have by not knowing about the cat. 근데 어쩔수 없음 그렇게 됐다. </p>
<p style="margin-top: 20px;"> Moca was born as a street cat in the restaurnat located in D7, HCMC. 국밥집이었다. His mom was startving and roamming the street and happened to give a birth in the 국밥 restaurant, where the owner was not that tolelated, so that after they became 2months after the birth the owner had decided to throw away the all baby cats. As one korean lady in the area heard about it, she posted up the news on katalk channel and it was a chance to Lucie to make a new brother to Latte, and without hesitating she took a  boy from the restaurant and name him Moca. </p>
